# Deploying the Chaz3 app

Examples for deployments are described and defined here. I have created these to get hands on experience on various environments and tools.

## Docker compose
Just get a simple server and run all the service containers configured to work together. Read the details in [this other document](docker-compose/README.md).

## K8S with HELM
Run Kubernetes or Minikube and install the app using a HELM chart!

## AWS Serverless
Utilize AWS Lambda to go serverless and run on demand only.
